2. Build an emergency fund
	If unforeseen costs occur, you can think of an emergency fund as a safety net. Generally, you want to have 3 to 6 months of your monthly costs saved in a savings account.

Having this fund can provide peace of mind when something unexpected happens. Here are some resources explaining an emergency fund and how it should be used. Also linked is an online bank that provides users with high-yield savings accounts (HYSA) so that your savings can gain interest!
